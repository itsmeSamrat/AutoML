## Description

Waste management is one of the challenging problems humans have been trying to solve for many years. This article aims to use AI to segregate waste into different categories.

It is believed that 60% of all recyclable waste is dumped into wastelands along with non-recyclable waste simply because most of the world does not have an efficient system to segregate different kinds of waste articles. That is where our project comes into the picture.Enabling users, officials, households, and the government to segregate waste at its root i.e., at home or offices, by making a small change, at the base of the problem. Follow the steps in [getting started](#getting-started)
